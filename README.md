# clean-vs-messy-room-classification

A Convolutional Neural Network is a powerful neural network that uses filters to extract features from images. It also does so in such a way that position information of pixels is retained.
Neural networks have led to huge breakthroughs in machine learning and are the fundamental reason behind the deep learning boom. Neural networks like CNNs have proved particularly successful in working with image data and ever since being used in ImageNet competition in 2012, they have been the frontrunners in research and industry while dealing with images.

Image classification is where a computer can analyse an image and identify the 'class' the image falls under. (Or a probability of the image being part of a 'class'.) 

Here we try ti classify whether a room is messy  or clean with the help of CNN
